Loading a Dataset
=================

Loading data is a fundamental step in any data analysis or modeling workflow.
To extract insights or train models, the raw data must be accessed in a consistent, reliable, and reproducible manner.
In this example, we use `Ensaio <https://github.com/fatiando/ensaio>`_ to fetch a dataset containing microscopy measurements of a speleothem, ensuring both accessibility and data integrity.

    `Ensaio <https://github.com/fatiando/ensaio>`_ serves as a reliable source for sharing reproducible research data in geophysics, providing persistent URLs
    and metadata for each dataset. The datasets in Ensaio are stored on platforms like Figshare or Zenodo,
    and each one includes a unique `SHA256` has to ensure file integrity.
