Creating Synthetic Magnetic Microscopy Data
===========================================

Synthetic data allows for controlled experiments and method validation
without the complexity of real-world noise and acquisition artifacts.
In this example, we simulate vertical magnetic field maps (`Bz`) generated by
magnetic dipoles embedded in a sample, mimicking data from high-resolution
magnetic microscopy.

We start with a simple case using a **single dipole**, then expand to a more
complex model with multiple sources.
