Creating Synthetic Magnetic Microscopy Data
===========================================

Synthetic data allows for controlled experiments and method validation
without the complexity of real-world noise and acquisition artifacts.
In this example, we simulate vertical magnetic field maps (`Bz`) generated by
magnetic dipoles embedded in a sample, simulating data from high-resolution
magnetic microscopy.

We start with a simple case using a **single dipole**, then expand to a more
complex model with multiple sources.

    Beginning with a single dipole helps isolate and understand the basic shape of the magnetic anomaly, 
    the effect of dipole orientation, and the spatial decay of the magnetic field.

Simulating a Single Dipole
--------------------------

We simulate a single magnetic dipole located at the center of a 1x1 mm area, 15 µm below the sample surface. The observation grid is placed 5 µm above the sample, and the dipole orientation is generated randomly around a mean direction.

Step 1: Import necessary packages
`````````````````````````````````
.. jupyter-execute::

    import numpy as np
    import verde as vd
    import magali as mg
    import harmonica as hm

Step 2: Define grid and simulation parameters
`````````````````````````````````````````````

We define the grid extent, spacing, and the height of the magnetic sensor above the sample.

.. jupyter-execute::

    sensor_sample_distance = 5.0  # µm
    region = [0, 1000, 0, 1000]  # µm
    spacing = 2  # µm

Step 3: Set the dipole orientation parameters
`````````````````````````````````````````````

We define the mean direction (inclination and declination) of the dipole moment and a small dispersion angle.

.. jupyter-execute::

    true_inclination = 30  # degrees
    true_declination = 40  # degrees
    true_dispersion_angle = 5  # degrees
    size = 1  # only one dipole

Step 4: Generate random dipole orientation
``````````````````````````````````````````

We use a helper function to generate a random orientation around the true direction.

.. jupyter-execute::

    directions_inclination, directions_declination = mg.random_directions(
        true_inclination,
        true_declination,
        true_dispersion_angle,
        size=size,
        random_state=5,
    )

Step 5: Define dipole location and moment
`````````````````````````````````````````

The dipole is located at the center of the region and placed 15 µm below the surface. Its moment has a small magnitude, pointing in the random direction defined earlier.

.. jupyter-execute::

    dipole_coordinates = (500, 500, -15)  # x, y, z in µm

    dipole_moments = hm.magnetic_angles_to_vec(
        inclination=directions_inclination,
        declination=directions_declination,
        intensity=5e-11,  # A·m²
    )

Step 6: Simulate the magnetic field
```````````````````````````````````

We now compute the vertical magnetic field (`Bz`) produced by this single dipole over the defined grid.

.. jupyter-execute::

    data = mg.dipole_bz_grid(
        region, spacing, sensor_sample_distance,
        dipole_coordinates, dipole_moments
    )

Step 7: Visualize the results
`````````````````````````````

The magnetic field is shown using a diverging colormap. Note the characteristic dipolar shape of the field.

.. jupyter-execute::

    data.plot.pcolormesh(cmap="seismic", vmin=-5000, vmax=5000)

Simulating a Complex Dipole Distribution
----------------------------------------

After understanding the basic behavior of a single magnetic source, we can now
simulate a more realistic scenario with multiple dipoles. This setup includes
dozens of randomly distributed and oriented dipoles, with a few manually 
placed stronger sources.

We simulate a complex magnetic source model containing 100 randomly oriented
dipoles and 3 manually defined dipoles with known properties. The sources are
located beneath a 2x2 mm area, and the magnetic field is computed on a dense
observation grid 5 µm above the sample.

Step 1: Import necessary packages
```````````````````````````````````
.. jupyter-execute::

    import numpy as np
    import verde as vd
    import magali as mg
    import harmonica as hm

Step 2: Define grid and simulation parameters
`````````````````````````````````````````````

We define a larger simulation region and keep the same grid spacing and sensor-sample distance.

.. jupyter-execute::

    sensor_sample_distance = 5.0  # µm
    region = [0, 2000, 0, 2000]  # µm
    spacing = 2  # µm

Step 3: Set dipole orientation model
````````````````````````````````````

We define a region on the surface of a sphere centered around a mean direction, with a small dispersion angle.

.. jupyter-execute::

    true_inclination = 30  # degrees
    true_declination = 40  # degrees
    true_dispersion_angle = 5  # degrees
    size = 100  # number of random dipoles

Step 4: Generate dipole directions
``````````````````````````````````

We sample inclination and declination angles from the distribution.

.. jupyter-execute::

    directions_inclination, directions_declination = mg.random_directions(
        true_inclination,
        true_declination,
        true_dispersion_angle,
        size=size,
        random_state=5,
    )

Step 5: Define dipole locations and intensities
````````````````````````````````````````````````

Dipoles are randomly positioned within the region. We also manually append three additional dipoles with higher magnetic intensity.

.. jupyter-execute::

    dipoles_amplitude = abs(np.random.normal(0, 100, size)) * 1.0e-14

    dipole_coordinates = (
        np.concatenate([np.random.randint(30, 1970, size), [1250, 1300, 500]]),  # x
        np.concatenate([np.random.randint(30, 1970, size), [500, 1750, 1000]]),  # y
        np.concatenate([np.random.randint(-20, -1, size), [-15, -15, -30]]),     # z
    )

Step 6: Construct dipole moment vectors
````````````````````````````````````````

We combine the random and manual sources into a single set of moment vectors.

.. jupyter-execute::

    dipole_moments = hm.magnetic_angles_to_vec(
        inclination=np.concatenate([directions_inclination, [10, -10, -5]]),
        declination=np.concatenate([directions_declination, [10, 170, 190]]),
        intensity=np.concatenate([dipoles_amplitude, [5e-11, 5e-11, 5e-11]]),
    )

Step 7: Simulate the magnetic field
```````````````````````````````````

We calculate the total vertical field (``Bz``) from all sources at each point on the grid.

.. jupyter-execute::

    data = mg.dipole_bz_grid(
        region, spacing, sensor_sample_distance,
        dipole_coordinates, dipole_moments
    )

Step 8: Visualize the results
`````````````````````````````

The resulting field shows the combined magnetic signal of all sources.

.. jupyter-execute::

    data.plot.pcolormesh(cmap="seismic", vmin=-5000, vmax=5000)
